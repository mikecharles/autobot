# Why do we exist?

We want to help you maintain your very own [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) installation, and develop your own Hubot scripts. Here is how we help:

**In Dev**
- Create a local dev environment (Hubot installed and configured for you)
- Easily test your own Hubot scripts in the dev environment
- Maintain your own private Hubot scripts

**In Prod**
- Publish your own Hubot scripts for easy consumption
- Manage a remote Hubot environment on your own server (e.g one you own in AWS)
- Make sure your Hubot environments are always up to date with your latest scripts  

## Why do I need autobot?
autobot is designed to be personalised. He doesn't come with a set of pre-defined scripts. He's there to help you manage all the back of house tasks, so you can focus on creating Hubot scripts for your very own robot.

Let's pretend your organisation is `ACME`. We hope you use autobot to create you very own robot called `ACMEbot`. He'll be populated with scripts that you've created and he'll do all the things you want him to do.

# Getting Help

The autobot project is managed through GitHub issues, and our waffle board makes it easy to see what we're working on, and any outstanding issues [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/autocorp/autobot.svg?label=ready&title=Ready)](http://waffle.io/autocorp/autobot)

You can also get more information by visiting our [wiki](https://github.com/autocorp/autobot/wiki).

# Getting Started

We've created jeeves so he can do all the heavy lifting for you. He'll make sure you have the required software, and help you with the day to day development too.

Jeeves can check lots of things for you, but we only need to worry about software dependencies right now. Make sure you're all green for the the required software and you can move on to creating your very own local development environment.

```
# Donwload a copy of autobot
git clone git@github.com:autocorp/autobot.git; cd autobot;

# Let Jeeves check your system for the required software
./bin/jeeves --check software

# Ask Jeeves how to create a local dev environment (for testing Hubot scripts)
./bin/jeeves --run local

```

He's still learning so make sure to raise an [issue](https://github.com/autocorp/autobot/issues) if you think he could help you out a little better.


## A closer look at the development environment

You can go ahead and run the commands Jeeves gave you when you did a `jeeves -r local`, but for those that are curious we're going to breakdown what's going on here.

1. `docker-machine create -d virtualbox dev` will instruct docker-machine to create a Virtual Machine called `dev`. This will be used to house your Hubot container for local development of Hubot scripts.

2. You'll then run `eval "$(docker-machine env dev)"` to make sure all your `docker-*` commands are targeted to your dev container.

3. Finally, the `docker-compose build hubot && docker run -it --rm autobot_hubot:latest hubot` command will spin up a new Hubot container in your local `dev` Virtual Machine.

All the scripts from the `hubot-scripts` folder will be loaded for you (so you can place scripts in there while you're doing local development).

At this stage you should be at the `Hubot>` prompt, and the `badgers` demo script should be loaded for you. Try talking to Hubot, like this `Hubot> @hubot how do you feel about badgers`.

Hubot should respond with:
```
Hubot> @hubot how do you feel about badgers
Badgers? BADGERS? WE DON'T NEED NO STINKIN BADGERS
```

## Life after dev
Now that you've got a local development environment, you'll want to write your own scripts. You can read up on [Hubot Scripting](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md) to get started and drop you very own Hubot script into `./hubot-scripts` when you're ready to test them out.

Other tasks will make use of more bits of technology and connections, like `Redis`, `Confluence` and `Hipchat`. We'll get stuck into those in another example.

# Deploying to a real environment

You can ask Jeeves to help you deploy autobot to a real environment, and by real we mean one that's not sitting on your local machine.

## Assumptions

This is still a new feature, so there are quite a few assumptions being made here. At this stage, results may vary. You've been warned!

1. AWS account
2. Drone account
3. Hipchat account
4. Confluence account
5. A `group_vars/all` file (You can use the `group_vars/example` as a template). Make sure you supply values for `AWS`, `drone`, `hipchat`, `confluence`.

## Jeeves. Run. Remote.

After all that, life is simple, just ask Jeeves for a bit of help deploying remotly
```
./bin/jeeves --run remote
```

Pro-Tip: He's really just going to tell you to run `ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml` but he'll throw in a few pointers so go ahead and try anyway.

## What's going on behind the scenes?


The result is pretty neat, you'll end up with a new EC2 node, with 3 containers `hubot`, `redis` and `drone`.

Redis is the datastore (or brain) for Hubot, and drone is the continuous integration container (it updates hubot every time you make commits to your repo).

While we're talking about neat things lets talk about what happens if the EC2 node is terminated, or something else equally awful happens. You just run the remote command again and everything will be re-created for you again, just like magic.

That's right folks programming is magic!
*(disclaimer, it's not actually magic, it's just programming)*.
